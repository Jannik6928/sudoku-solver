# sudoku-solver

 This was my first ever project, and it was written in C++. I really didn't know what I was doing at the time and looking back, there is a lot of strange code. I think I have progressed a lot since then! Below are 2 images, the first showing the puzzle I solved with my algorithm (it was hard-coded for some reason) and its solution. It was unable to solve it completely using Sudoku Rules, so it eliminated as many candidates as possible, and then brute-forced the solution. It was a bit of an ambitious first CS project, but I enjoyed working on it.


## Rules
